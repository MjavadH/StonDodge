# StonDodge 🚀

In the vast darkness of space, survival is a simple, brutal rule:

Dodge or be annihilated!

You are hunted by a storm of asteroids, giant meteor lords, and relentless foes. Your only path to survival is through lightning-fast reactions, pinpoint accuracy, and strategic use of powerful abilities.

With just one finger, command your starship in a perpetual war, where every second is a life-or-death choice and every shot counts.

This is more than a game—it's an eternal battle for existence.

Are you prepared to carve a path through the cosmos and prove to the lords of space who truly commands the galaxy?
